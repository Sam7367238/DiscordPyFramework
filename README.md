Discord.py is a wrapper for Discord's API, it is written in the Python programming language.
This is a framework built on discord.py that makes developing Discord applications much easier.

Tools:
- SQLite Database Integration And Repositories
- Configuration Tools

Note:
This will automatically create an AppDatabase.db file. When using database tools in repositories, be sure the file path is "AppDatabase.db", it is designed like that because of some...complications.
